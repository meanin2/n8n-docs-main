build-json-workflows.txt: n8n workflows are defined in JSON, each workflow is a JSON object specifying nodes and connections. Workflow structure: Root Object (name, nodes array, connections object, pinData/meta/active/settings metadata). Nodes: id (UUID), name (friendly name), type & typeVersion (functionality and version), parameters (node settings), position (visual editor placement), credentials (optional, for authentication). Connections: maps node outputs to inputs, defining execution order. Writing workflow: 1. Define Root Object (name, empty nodes/connections). 2. Add Nodes (id, name, type, typeVersion, parameters, position, configure parameters). 3. Set Up Connections (connections object, map data flow). 4. Include Credentials (credentials key for external services). 5. Test and Iterate (Import JSON, verify layout, test workflow). Minimal Example: Trigger node connected to Code node, demonstrating workflow JSON structure. Observations from Examples: Complexity/variety, Dynamic expressions, Documentation within workflows. Conclusion: Workflow built from nodes array and connections mapping. Each node configured with type, parameters, position. Connections object controls execution order. Use this to write JSON workflows from scratch, import into n8n.

docs.txt: n8n automation platform: built-in integrations, workflow management, execution monitoring. Built-in integrations: node library, credentials. Core nodes: logic, scheduling, generic API calls. Cluster nodes: extend functionality. Credentials: encrypted storage, access rights controlled. Community nodes: custom extensions, installation/creation guidance. API rate limits: retry on fail, batching requests. HTTP Request node: built-in batching, pagination. AI glossary: completion, hallucinations, vector database/store. Workflows: interconnected nodes, visual canvas creation, JSON format, export/import, version history (workflow/execution history), workflow settings (execution order, error workflow, timezone, save executions/progress), workflow sharing (Pro/Enterprise), tags, templates, workflow IDs. Workflow building blocks: nodes, connections, sticky notes. Nodes: core elements, testing/deactivation/deletion/context actions, settings (request options, Always Output Data, Execute Once, Retry On Fail, error handling). Connections: data routing links. Sticky notes: Markdown annotations. Executions: workflow runs (manual, partial, production), executions list (workflow/global level, filterable), retry failed executions, custom execution data (JavaScript/Python), manual executions (testing, data pinning), partial executions (re-run nodes), production executions (automatic). n8n documentation: guidance on integrations, API rate limits, AI terminology, workflow creation/management, workflow components, execution monitoring, ensures users can design, test, deploy, debug robust automated processes in structured, secure, scalable environment.
